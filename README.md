# Programming Exercises
In this repository, you will find exercises that I solved in two languages: Java and Python. They are the same exercises, presented in both languages. They range from the simplest to the most complex. You can send me an exercise in the last file of one of the folders if you want (I will solve the exercises as soon as possible and solve them in other languages too).
